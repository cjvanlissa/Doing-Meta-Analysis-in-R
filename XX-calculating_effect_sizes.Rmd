# Calculating Effect Sizes {#calc}

![](calculate.jpg)

Papers do not always report the effect sizes exactly the way you want to meta-analyze them. This chapter addresses the basics of calculating effect sizes.

```{block,type='rmdinfo'}
Meta-Analysis requires an **effect size** and an estimate of the **sampling variance** of that effect size for each study. Papers do not always report the effect size, or they report a different effect size than the one you want to use in your meta-analysis. This chapter addresses the basics of calculating effect sizes.

It may not immediately be obvious whether a paper reports the necessecary statistics to calculate an effect size. You will need an 'effect size' and its sampling variance. As a general guideline, ask yourself these questions:

1. Am I meta-analyzing a descriptive statistic (mean, SD, proportion, Cronbach's alpha), a measure of *association* (correlation or bivariate regression coefficient), or a difference (e.g., mean difference)?
2. Is that statistic reported directly?
3. Is its variance or SE reported directly?
4. Do I have the sample size for the total group or for each group I'm comparing?
5. Are measures of variability reported (e.g., SD for each group)?

If you cannot figure out whether you have sufficient information to calculate the effect size, I recommend contacting a statistician.

Researchers can get quite creative in trying to obtain the relevant information. It is expected that researchers contact authors of papers with incomplete information to request that information. Many journals **require** the authors to provide this information upon request. Moreover, researchers sometimes use an on-screen ruler (e.g., https://www.arulerforwindows.com/) to measure means and SEs from graphs, if these are not reported in the text of the paper.

## Calculating standardized mean differences {#fixed}

To calculate standardized mean differences (SMD), we need means, SDs, and sample
sizes per group. In this example, we'll be looking at the `dat.normand1999`
dataset included with `metafor`:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(metafor)
kable(dat.normand1999[, -1])
```

To calculate effect sizes, we use the function `metafor::escalc`, which incorporates
formulas to compute many different effect sizes. A detailed explanation, 
with references to the formulas used, can be found by selecting the function,
and pressing F1.

```{r, results = "hide"}
df_smd <- escalc(measure = "SMD",
                 m1i = m1i,
                 m2i = m2i,
                 sd1i = sd1i,
                 sd2i = sd2i,
                 n1i = n1i,
                 n2i = n2i,
                 data = dat.normand1999)
df_smd
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kable(df_smd[,-1])
```

Note that the function returns the original data, with two added columns: `yi` 
and `vi`. These are the SMD effect size and its variance.

## From formulas {#formula}

Sometimes, you want to use a specific formula to calculate the effect size - or
you just want the formula to be explicit, not hidden away inside `escalc`. You
can transcribe the formula into R syntax, and compute the effect size manually.

For this example, we use the the `dat.molloy2014` dataset, included with
`metafor`, which contains correlations, and their sample sizes:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
kable(dat.molloy2014[, c(1,3,4)])
```

Because correlations are bounded by [-1, 1], they are often Fisher-transformed
prior to meta-analysis. The formula for Fisher's *r-to-z* transformation is:

$$
z = .5 * ln(\frac{1+r}{1-r})
$$

In R-syntax, that formula is expressed as: `z <- .5 * log((1+r)/(1-r))`.

We can calculate a new column in the data, using this formula, by substituting
`r` with the column in the data that contains the correlations:

```{r}
df_cor <- dat.molloy2014
# Compute new column:
df_cor$zi <- .5 * log((1+df_cor$ri)/(1-df_cor$ri))
```

Alternatively, we can store the calculation as a *function*, which makes the 
code a bit cleaner:

```{r}
# Create function r_to_z, which takes r as input:
r_to_z <- function(r){.5 * log((1+r)/(1-r))}
# Apply the function to compute new column:
df_cor$zi <- r_to_z(df_cor$ri)
```


The sampling variance for the transformed correlations is:

$$
V_z = \frac{1}{n-3}
$$

So by the same process, we can add the sampling variance to the data:

```{r}
# Create function v_z, which takes n as input:
v_z <- function(n){1/(n-3)}
# Apply the function to compute new column:
df_cor$vi <- v_z(df_cor$ni)
```
