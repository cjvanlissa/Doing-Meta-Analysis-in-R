# Robust variance estimation

A second solution to the problem of dependent data with unknown sampling covariances is **robust variance estimation**. This chapter illustrates how to get robust variance estimates for standard errors of `metafor` models.


## Robust variance estimation

The package `clubSandwich` can perform robust variance estimation for a variety of models - including the `rma` models created by `metafor`. This is convenient, because it means that we can simply specify our model in the same way as before. Then, we take the output of our `rma` analysis, and use it as input for the robust variance estimation function `clubSandwich::coef_test`. 

Robust variance estimation is another way to account for dependent data (multiple outcomes from one study/sample). Thus, we need to indicate a 'clustering' variable again. When we pass our `rma` output to `coef_test`, the function automatically uses the outermost level of our multilevel model.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", message=FALSE}
library(metaforest)
df <- curry
```

We first re-fit the three-level multilevel meta-analysis from before, which uses REML to estimate the variance components:

```{r, message = FALSE}
m_multi <- rma.mv(yi = d, V = vi, random = list(~1 | effect_id, ~1 | study_id), data = df)
m_multi
```

The standard errors, t-tests, and confidence intervals from `rma` are all parameteric and model-based. The `clubSandwich::coef_test` function will calculate robust standard errors and robust t-tests for each of the coefficients:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install if necessary
install.packages("clubSandwich")
library(clubSandwich)

clubSandwich::coef_test(m_multi, vcov = "CR2")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(clubSandwich)

print(clubSandwich::coef_test(m_multi, vcov = "CR2"))
```

Note that `coef_test` assumed that it should cluster based on `studyID`, which is the outer-most random effect in the metafor model. This can be specified explicitly by including the option `cluster = df$effect_id` in the call. 

The `vcov = "CR2"` option means that the standard errors will be corrected using the bias-reduced linearization estimator described in Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015).
